Understanding data structures is crucial for writing efficient Python programs. Let's explore the most important ones and their use cases.

## Lists: The Swiss Army Knife

Lists are versatile and commonly used:

```python
# Creating and manipulating lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)      # Add element
numbers.pop()         # Remove last element
numbers.insert(0, 0)  # Insert at index
```

## Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs

Perfect for mapping relationships:

```python
# Dictionary operations
student = {
    'name': 'John',
    'age': 20,
    'grades': [85, 90, 88]
}

# Accessing and modifying
print(student['name'])
student['age'] = 21
```

## Sets: Unique Collections

Ideal for removing duplicates and membership testing:

```python
# Set operations
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
more_numbers = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Union, intersection, difference
union = numbers | more_numbers
intersection = numbers & more_numbers
difference = numbers - more_numbers
```

## Tuples: Immutable Sequences

Use when data shouldn't change:

```python
# Tuple examples
coordinates = (10, 20)
rgb = (255, 128, 0)

# Tuple unpacking
x, y = coordinates
```

## When to Use Each

1. **Lists**: Ordered collections that can change
2. **Dictionaries**: When you need key-value relationships
3. **Sets**: For unique items and mathematical set operations
4. **Tuples**: For immutable sequences of data

## Performance Considerations

- Lists: O(1) for append, O(n) for insert
- Dictionaries: O(1) average case for access
- Sets: O(1) average case for membership testing
- Tuples: Immutable, slightly more memory efficient
