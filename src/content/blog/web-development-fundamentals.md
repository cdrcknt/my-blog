Web development is a vast and exciting field that forms the backbone of our digital world. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts that every aspiring web developer should master.

## The Three Pillars of Web Development

### 1. HTML - Structure
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the foundation for all web content. It's the skeleton that gives structure to web pages:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. CSS - Style
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings design and layout to your HTML structure:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
}

h1 {
    color: #2563eb;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### 3. JavaScript - Interactivity
JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity to web pages:

```javascript
function greetUser() {
    const name = prompt('What is your name?');
    alert(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to web development.`);
}
```

## Best Practices for Modern Web Development
